# Secure External Password Store

Place the wallet for the Secure External Password Store into this directory (or another directory you like more). Make sure to update the path to the wallet, e.g. `TNS_ADMIN` in `application.properties`, as well as the `sqlnet.ora`file you use.

If you are unsure you can use instructions as found in an [earlier blog post](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/connecting-to-a-database-using-sqlcl-a-wallet-and-the-thin-driver/).
