A collection of code from my Java related blogposts

## Maven Example 1

This example shows how to use the Secure External Password Store together with Maven to write a simple database application.

The corresponding blog post can be found at [https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/jdbc-the-oracle-database-using-maven-central/](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/jdbc-the-oracle-database-using-maven-central/)

Requires the Secure External Password Store to be in place before this code can be executed.

## TAF Demo

A short demonstration on why you need the Oracle Call Interface Driver (OCI) when writing Java code making use of Transparent Application Failover. The corresponding blog post was written in 2020, updated 07/2021 and can be found at [https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/08/18/jdbc-the-oracle-database-if-you-want-transparent-application-failover-you-need-the-oci-driver/](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/08/18/jdbc-the-oracle-database-if-you-want-transparent-application-failover-you-need-the-oci-driver/)

This demo also requires setting up the secure external password store. Details are provided in the blog post covering the Maven example.
