A collection of code from my Java related blogposts

## Maven Example 1

This example shows how to use the Secure External Password Store together with Maven to write a simple database application.

The corresponding blog post can be found at [https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/jdbc-the-oracle-database-using-maven-central/](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/jdbc-the-oracle-database-using-maven-central/)

Requires the Secure External Password Store to be in place before this code can be executed.
